## Description

The whole idea of SafeSpace is to build a suite of tools and technologies which are powered by [Pangea](https://pangea.cloud/) security services, to provide users a secure and private environment while browsing the internet.

## SafeSpace Browser Extension

The SafeSpace browser extension is a companion tool that provides users with a secure and private browsing experience. The extension is powered by Pangea security services and provides users with the following features:

- **Site Security**: Every website you visit is analyzed by Pangea security services to ensure that it is not a known malicious site. On top of that the extension also checks whether the site implements some of the best securty practises like security headers, etc. All these information is evaluated in an algorithm to provide a security score for the website. This score is then displayed to the user in the form of a badge on the extension icon. And a complete report can be viewed by clicking on the extension icon.
